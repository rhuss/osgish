INTRODUCTION

  PLEASE NOTE THAT VERSION 0.1 IS A PREVIEW ONLY.

  Osgish is command line shell for OSGi. It is based on the Readline
  Library, Jmx4Perl as OSGi Backend and Aries JMX as OSGi Management
  layer, with Perl being the glue.

  Highlights of osgish are:

  * Readline and History support based on GNU Readline/History as
    known from other shells like 'bash'.
  * Context sensitive argument completion, e.g. on bundle symbolic
    names. 
  * Colored output (can be switched off)
  * Multi-Server support
  * Remote operation

  THIS IS A PREVIEW. Currently you can list, start and stop bundles
  only. A lot of additional functionality is planned making osgish a
  full featured OSGi shell. If you have a use case you want to have
  covered, please don't hesistate to contact
  roland@cpan.org. Everything is in the flow yet.

HOW IT WORKS

  Osgish consist of mainly two parts: A Perl command line script
  (along with some Perl modules) which connects to an OSGi container
  via a special OSGi agent bundle (osgish-agent.jar). This bundle
  contains the jmx4perl for exports JMX information through an OSGi
  HttpService as JSON data. The JMX MBeans used are those provided by
  the Aries (http://incubator.apache.org/aries/) which becomes an
  implementation of the (yet to be finished) specification of the OSGi
  Alliance Enterprise Expert Group (EEG), especially the "JMX
  Management Model Specification".  

  Although this setup sounds a bit involved, installation is not much
  more than installing a CPAN package and a provided OSGi bundle (the
  same as for jmx4perl). 

INSTALLATION

  The Perl part installs as any other module via Module::Build, which
  you need to have installed. Using

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  ./Build install

  will install the modules. If you have Java and Maven (a Java build
  tool) installed, the agent bundle will be compiled and packaged as
  well when you use './Build dist'. However, this is not required as a
  prepackaged bundle is contained within the agent directory.

  Osgish depends on the Perl Module 'Term::ReadLine' (indirectly via
  Term::ShellUI), which can be used with various backend Readline
  implementations. The most powerful (and hence recommended)
  implementation is GNU Readline/History Library which will be used if
  installed. It is really worth to go the extra way to install GNU
  readline, even on OS X or Windows (which is not trivial). E.g. for
  OS X you can use the package 'p5-term-readline-gnu' to install
  readline along with the needed module. 

  For the module to work, you need to provision
  "osgi-agent-<version>.jar" to each OSGi container you want to
  connect to. Refer to you OSGi framework in use how to install a
  bundle (e.g. by calling 'install' in a OSGi shell or providing the
  bundle name during startup). This bundle has a dependency on an OSGi
  HttpService, which need to be available. Some OSGi container (like
  Glassfish v3) already come with a HttpService installed, for other
  you need to install one manually. A good choice is the Pax Web
  (http://wiki.ops4j.org/display/paxweb/Pax+Web) HttpService. Select
  the pax-web-jetty-bundle when downloading, it contains a all you
  need.

  Considered you installed the HttpService at its default port 8080, 
  you can connect to it via

  osgish --server http://localhost:8080/j4p

  (This assumes, that the HttpService has a root context '/' which is
  true for Pax Web. Glassfish v3's HttpService use a root context of
  '/osgi' which results in a connect URL of
  http://localhost:8080/osgi/j4p)

SUPPORTED OSGI PLAFORMS
  
  The following OSGi platform has been confirmed to work so far
  with: 

  * Felix 2.0.1
  * Equinox 3.5.1
  * Glassfish v3 (with Felix included)
  * Spring dm Server 2.0

  Since OSGi bundles are highly portable, it is expected that every
  OSGi server with an installed HttpService should work out of the
  box.  Please open a bug at
  http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Report.html?Queue=osgish if you
  encounter any problems.
