=head1 NAME 

OSGi::Osgish - Main osgish object 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This object is pushed to commands and allows access to all relevant
informations shared between commands. A command should consult the 
osgish object when performing its operation for contacting the OSGi server. 
The osgish object gets updated in the background e.g. when the server changes.
