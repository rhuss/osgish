=head1 NAME 

OSGi::Osgish::CommandHandler - Handler for osgish commands

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This object is responsible for managing L<OSGi::Osgish::Command> object which
are at the heart of osgish and provide all features. During startup it
registeres commands dynamicallt and pushes the L<OSGi::Osgish> context to them
for allowing to access the agent and other handlers.

Registration is occurs in two phases:

...

It also keeps a stack of so called navigational I<context> which can be used to
provide a menu like structure (think of it like directories which can be
entered). If the stack contains elements, the navigational commands C<..> and
C</> are added to traverse the stack. C</> will always jump to the top of the
stack (the I<root directory>) whereas C<..> will pop up one level in the stack
(the I<parent directory>). Commands which want to manipulate the stack like
pushing themselves on the stack should use the methods L</push_on_stack> or
L</reset_stack> (for jumping to the top of the menu).

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item $command_handler = new OSGi::Osgish::CommandHandler($osgish,$shell)

Create a new command handler object. The arguments to be passed are the osgish
object (C<$osgish>) and the shell object (C<$shell>) in order to update the
shell's current command set.

sub new { 
    my $class = shift;
    my $osgish = shift || "No osgish object given";    
    my $shell = shift || "No shell given";
    my $self = {
                osgish => $osgish,
                shell => $shell
               };
    $self->{stack} = [];
    bless $self,(ref($class) || $class);
    $shell->term->prompt($self->_prompt);
    $self->_register_commands;
    return $self;
}

=item $comand_handler->push_on_stack($context,$cmds)

Update the stack with an entry of name C<$context> which provides the commands
C<$cmds>. C<$cmds> must be a hashref as known to L<Term::ShellUI>, whose
C<commands> method is used to update the shell. Additionally it updates the
shell's prompt to reflect the state of the stack.

       }
      );    
}

=item $command_handler->reset_stack

Reset the stack and install the top and global commands as collected from the
registered L<OSGi::Osgish::Command>.

Get a registered command by name
